## My interests
My interests are playing video games, watching sports, playing chess, and going to the gym. The current video games I love to play are Guild Wars 2 and Apex Legends. I love watching MLB and NFL games. I'm a huge Baltimore Orioles and Baltimore Ravens fan. My academic interests are to succeed in my classes with the grades and knowledge to be successful in my future career. My personal interests are being able to code with ease and learn as much as possible. 
## Websites I Recommend
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) - YouTube is a website that I would highly recommend because the content on there can be both educational and entertaining. You can watch about anything from how to fix a tire to how to achieve the highest amount of gold in Guild Wars 2.
- [ESPN](https://www.espn.com) - ESPN is one of my favorite websites because it tells me almost everything about the sports world. I can view the trades in different sports. I can read articles about different topics, like **"Are the Dodgers ruining baseball?"**.
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) - Codecademy is another website that I enjoy because it gives me more knowledge about the different types of coding languages. Eventually, I want to complete every lesson while being knowledgeable in each language.
- [Chess](https://www.chess.com/) - Chess is a website I use almost every day because it is game I can play anywhere and anytime. I love the strategy and entertainment it brings. I love the challenge of playing against other people across the world at different levels.
